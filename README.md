# Gmail Labels & Queries as Tabs

A Chrome extension that injects a user-configurable tabs bar into Gmail. Each tab corresponds to an exact Gmail label name chosen by the user.

## Features

-   **Customizable Tabs**: Add, remove, and reorder tabs for your most used labels and search queries.
-   **Drag & Drop**: Easily reorder tabs with drag and drop.
-   **Themes**: Choose between Light, Dark, or System themes.
-   **Data Export/Import**: Backup and restore your configuration.
-   **Seamless Integration**: Tabs look and feel like part of Gmail.
-   **Sync**: Settings are synced across all your Chrome instances.
-   **Privacy Focused**: No external network requests, no analytics.

## Build Instructions

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Build**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This will compile TypeScript and copy assets to the `dist/` directory.

3.  **Watch Mode (for development)**:
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```
    Note: You may need to manually run `npm run copy-assets` if you change static files, or use a separate watcher.

4.  **Package**:
    ```bash
    npm run package
    ```
    Creates `extension.zip` in the root directory.

## Installation

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
3.  Click "Load unpacked".
4.  Select the `dist` directory generated by the build step.

## Usage

1.  Open Gmail.
2.  Click the extension icon or use the "Add tab" button to configure your labels and search queries as Tabs.
3.  Tabs will appear below the main Gmail toolbar.

## Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect any user data. All settings are stored locally in your browser using `chrome.storage.sync` and are only used to display the tabs you have configured. No data is sent to any third-party servers.
